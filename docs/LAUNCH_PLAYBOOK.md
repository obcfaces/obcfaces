## First 72 Hours (Critical Period)

The first 3 days are crucial for catching issues, gathering feedback, and building momentum.

### Hour 0-2: Immediate Post-Deploy

**✅ Technical Verification**
```bash
# Run immediately after deploy
curl -s https://obcface.com/healthcheck
curl -sI https://obcface.com | grep -i "strict-transport\|content-security"
BASE_URL=https://obcface.com pnpm test:e2e

# Check first metrics
npx lighthouse https://obcface.com --preset=perf --view
```

**✅ Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Cloudflare Analytics dashboard open (tab 1)
- [ ] Supabase logs dashboard open (tab 2)
- [ ] Sentry error tracking open (tab 3)
- [ ] Product Hunt page open (tab 4)
- [ ] Social media mentions tracking (tab 5)

**✅ Communication**
- [ ] Post on Product Hunt (7-9 AM PST, Tuesday-Thursday)
- [ ] LinkedIn announcement posted
- [ ] Twitter thread published
- [ ] Email newsletter sent to subscribers
- [ ] Discord/Slack announcement (if applicable)

---

### Hour 2-24: Active Monitoring

**🔍 Metrics to Watch**

| Metric | Target | Action if Outside Range |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Error rate | < 1% | Investigate Sentry logs immediately |
| LCP (mobile) | < 2.5s | Check Cloudflare cache hit rate |
| API latency (p95) | < 600ms | Check Supabase query performance |
| Uptime | > 99.9% | Check healthcheck endpoint |
| Turnstile success | > 95% | Review CAPTCHA settings |

**📊 Traffic Analysis**
```
Cloudflare Analytics → Check:
- Geographic distribution
- Top pages visited
- Referral sources (Product Hunt, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Bot vs human traffic ratio
```

**🐛 Error Tracking**
```
Sentry → Filter by:
- Release: v1.0.0
- Time: Last 24 hours
- Severity: Error and above

Look for:
- New error types not seen in testing
- Errors from specific browsers/devices
- API endpoint failures
```

**💬 Community Engagement**

**Product Hunt (Critical!)**
- Respond to ALL comments within 2 hours
- Thank voters and commenters
- Answer technical questions thoroughly
- Share early metrics if positive

**Social Media**
- Retweet/share positive feedback
- Respond to questions and feedback
- Engage with community comments
- Share behind-the-scenes content

**Template Responses** (see [Response Templates](#response-templates))

2. Test locally: pnpm check:all
3. Open PR with "HOTFIX" label
4. Fast-track review
5. Deploy immediately after CI passes
6. Monitor for 1 hour post-deploy
```

## Post-Launch Observations & Learnings

> 💡 **Use this section to document real findings after launch**
> 
> This becomes your institutional knowledge for future releases.

### What Worked Well ✅

**Technical**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Batch API loading prevented server overload during traffic spike"]
- [e.g., "Cloudflare Turnstile had 99.2% success rate, better than expected"]
- [e.g., "E2E tests caught 3 critical bugs before production"]
```

**Marketing**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Product Hunt launch on Tuesday got 3x more upvotes than expected"]
- [e.g., "LinkedIn post with metrics performed better than feature highlights"]
- [e.g., "Video demo increased conversion by 40% vs static screenshots"]
```

**Process**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Pre-launch checklist prevented 2 near-misses"]
- [e.g., "Having rollback plan gave confidence to deploy"]
- [e.g., "Automated smoke tests saved 2 hours of manual QA"]
```

---

### What Didn't Work ❌

**Technical**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Image optimization wasn't aggressive enough, still seeing 3s LCP on slow 3G"]
- [e.g., "Rate limiting too strict for some legitimate users (10 votes/hr)"]
- [e.g., "CAPTCHA on login annoyed returning users"]
```

**Marketing**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Reddit post got downvoted - too promotional"]
- [e.g., "Email subject line had 12% open rate (expected 25%)"]
- [e.g., "Twitter thread too long - most engagement on first 3 tweets only"]
```

**Process**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Didn't set up monitoring alerts before launch - missed first error spike"]
- [e.g., "No backup person for Product Hunt responses - bottleneck on launch day"]
- [e.g., "Feedback form added too late - missed early user insights"]
```

---

### Unexpected Findings 🔍

**User Behavior**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "60% of users came from mobile, but we optimized for desktop first"]
- [e.g., "Users from Russia stayed 2x longer than other locales"]
- [e.g., "Most votes happened between 6-9 PM local time"]
```

**Technical**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Safari 16 had rendering bug we didn't catch in testing"]
- [e.g., "CDN cache hit rate lower than expected - need to adjust headers"]
- [e.g., "API latency spiked during first hour, then stabilized"]
```

**Market**:
```markdown
- [e.g., "Organic traffic from Google came faster than expected (day 3)"]
- [e.g., "WhatsApp sharing drove 30% of referrals (unexpected)"]
- [e.g., "Users requested feature X 10x more than feature Y"]
```
